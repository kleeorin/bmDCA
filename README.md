# Boltzmann-machine Direct Coupling Analysis (bmDCA)

Dependencies:
 * [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/)
 * [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP)

## Usage

C++ reimplementation of bmDCA adapted from [the
original](https://github.com/matteofigliuzzi/bmDCA) code. Method is described
in:

>  Figliuzzi, M., Barrat-Charlaix, P. & Weigt, M. How Pairwise Coevolutionary
>  Models Capture the Collective Residue Variability in Proteins? Molecular
>  Biology and Evolution 35, 1018â€“1027 (2018).

This code is optimized to eliminate the original's excessive file I/O and
time-consuming printing to std err and parallelize the MCMC in the inference
loop.

Steps to use the code:

### 1. Compile and install the code

To install the program globally (default: `/usr/local`), run:

```
./autogen.sh
make
sudo make install
```

If instead you want to install the code locally, run:
```
./autogen.sh --prefix=${HOME}/.local
make
make install
```

Replace the `--prefix` value with any local path that is part of the system
PATH.

In the event you with to uninstall the code, simply run `sudo make uninstall`
(or `make uninstall` if root permissions aren't needed).

### 2. Run bmDCA to learn the model parameters

This step is required to convert the MSA text file into numerical format.
```
bmdca -i input_alignment.fasta -d output_directory -r -c config_file.conf
```

The command line flags are:
 - `-i`: input MSA, FASTA format
 - `-d`: directory where output is written
 - `-r`: flag to compute re-weighting coefficients for each sequence in the
         alignment (optional)
 - `-c`: config file for bmDCA run hyperparameters (optional)

If `-r` is not specified, each sequence will be equally weighted, and if no
config file is supplied, the run will default to hyperparameters hard-coded in
the `initializeParameters()` function defined in `src/run.cpp`. The default
number of iterations for the Boltzmann machine is 2000.

The mapping from amino acids to integers is defined in the following way. Amino
acids are ordered as in the following string "-ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY". They are
then mapped to the integer corresponding to their position in the string, minus
one. The gap symbol is mapped to 0, A is mapped to 1, etc...

Depending how many times you configure `bmdca` to save steps to disk, the total
data generated can be substantial ( > 1 Gb). At present, the only way to
disable writing of a particular log file is to comment out the code in the
`Sim::run()` function defined in `src/run.cpp`.

#### Learned parameters

The output directory contains learned parameters saved in files called
`parameters_%d.txt`. They contain the parameters for both J and h, formatted
as follows:

```
J [position index i] [position index j] [amino acid index a] [amino acid index b]
.
.
.
h [positoin index i] [amino acid index a]
.
.
.
```

Indices of sites in the sequence go from 0 to L-1 in the output format.
